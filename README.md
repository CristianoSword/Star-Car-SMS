# star-car
Game for Sega Master System, only write code assembly z80

Compile win64:
wla-z80 -o racer.asm racer.o
wlalink -drvs linkfile star-car.sms
<br>
<br>
There's still a lot to do, but it's already compiling and the graphical headers and tiles have been started; the ROM is in \build star-car.sms<br>
I'll get back to it when I have the time and patience.😁<br>
